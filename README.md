 # Kubernetes Deployment

Deploying to Kubernetes involves creating deployment and service YAML files for the API and ensuring the PostgreSQL database is accessible within the cluster, possibly using a managed cloud database service for resilience.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

For IsC, use Terraform to script cloud infrastructure setup, including  Kubernetes cluster, database instances, and networking components.

- autoscaling should be defined for  API deployment to handle load variations.
- Secure sensitive information using secret management solutions.

# Observability

- Prometheus and Grafana: for metrics collection and visualization.
- ELK Stack: (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.
- Set up alerts using Prometheus Alertmanager or similar tools for anomaly detection.

# Security Vulnerability Checks

Include a step in the CI/CD pipeline to scan vulnerabilities in dependencies and container images:

- Tools like Trivy for scanning dependencies and Docker images.
- Integrate Trivy into the pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to ensure scans are performed before deployment.



# Sample Pipeline Step for Vulnerability Scanning


steps:
- name: Scan for vulnerabilities
  image: aquasec/trivy:latest
  script:
    - trivy filesystem --exit-code 1 --no-progress /


This step uses Trivy in a CI pipeline to scan the filesystem of the built image and fails the build if vulnerabilities are found.


# Deployment Prerequisites

1. Terraform Installed: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine.
2. Kubernetes Cluster: A running Kubernetes cluster (Minikube for local development).
3. Kubectl Configured: Ensure "kubectl" is configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.


# Pipeline Prerequisites

1. Jenkins Installed: Ensure Jenkins is installed and running.
2. Docker and Kubernetes Plugins: Install necessary Jenkins plugins for Docker and Kubernetes.
3. Docker and Kubernetes CLI: Ensure docker" and "kubectl" are installed on the Jenkins host or agents where the jobs will run.
4. Credentials: Add your Docker Registry and Kubernetes cluster credentials to Jenkins.
